title: "Analyze Tone Perception (1 syllable) - Carrier Syllable Effects"
output: html_notebook
---

### Motivation

One goal of the study is to determine whether the perceptual boundaries between tones varies more based on individual listeners or based on carrier syllables. Multilevel analysis in [Part I](https://xiaosquared.github.io/GepetoR/notebooks/1_analyzeTonePerceptionResults.nb.html) seemed to indicate more variation based on subject when all the syllables were pooled together. 

Now, I want to split the data, looking at pairs of syllables at a time. 

* High vs low vowel
  * */ma* vs */mi*
  * */ya* vs */yi*
* Effect of diphthong  
  * */ma* vs */mao*
* Effect of glide
  * */Mao* vs */Miao*
* Effect of nasal ending
  * */Yi* vs */Yin*
* Effect of aspiration
  * */Di* vs */Ti* 
* Other consonant effects
  * */Yi* vs */Xi*
  * *Yi* vs */Mi*
  * */Mi* vs */Xi*

# Loading data

source("../utils/dataWrangling.R") #helper functions to load data

subjects <- c("s29", "s30", "s31", "s32", "s33", "s34")
master <- get_results(subjects, "../data/single-syll-varied-tone-perception/")

# Function to data by syllable
get_data_syllables <- function(data, syll1, syll2) {
  filter(data, carrier_syllable == syll1 | carrier_syllable == syll2)
}
```

TODO:
- put data wrangling into one file
- put models into one file so they can be shared across notebooks
